    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let dog = "Rex";
    let puppy = dog;
    puppy = "Rexee";
    console.log(puppy);
    // dog is still "Rex"

    let age = 100;
    let size = age;
    size = 20;
    console.log(size);
    // age is still 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // const people = players;
    // console.log(people);
    // people[3] = 'Tom';
    // console.log(players);

    // 'Poppy' changed to 'Tom'


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const ppl2 = Array.from(players);
    ppl2[3] = 'Mike';
    console.log(ppl2);
    console.log(players);
    // I made a copy

    const ppl3 = players.slice();
    ppl3[3] = 'Peter';
    console.log(players);
    // It is also a copy!

    const ppl4 = [...players];
    ppl4[3] = 'Tony';
    console.log(ppl4);
    console.log(players);
    // ES6 feature called Spread


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
      name: "Daniel",
      age: 25
    }

    console.log(person);

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // const player = person;
    // player.name = "Lucas";
    // console.log(person);
    // Persons name changed to Lucas

    const player2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(player2);
    //I made a copy!

    player2.name = 'Marcus';
    console.log(person);
    // persons name remained Daniel!

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
